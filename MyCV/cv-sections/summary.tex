My background in linguistics and media psychology makes me an ideal fit for the annotator position with the Turing Institute. In my PhD research, I look at digital well-being and toxicity in video games, which is heavily intertwined with hate speech. Recent projects of mine have involved many hours of game feature annotation and transcription, so I am familiar with the type of work and can complement that with a strong conceptual understanding of AI and NLP. Creating healthy and respectful discourse online is a crucial issue
